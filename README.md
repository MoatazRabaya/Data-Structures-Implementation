# 📘 Data Structures in C#

This project contains my custom implementations of basic data structures in C#, created while studying Data Structures and Algorithms topics.

I built each structure from scratch to better understand how they work internally, rather than just using the built-in C# classes.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This solution includes multiple C# console applications that demonstrate how different data structures work.

### Implemented Data Structures:
- **MyList<T>** – Dynamic array similar to `List<T>`
- **MyStack<T>** – Stack implementation (LIFO: Last In, First Out)
- **MyQueue<T>** – Queue implementation (FIFO: First In, First Out)
- **MyLinkedList<T>** – Linked List implementation


Each data structure supports common operations like adding, removing, searching, and iterating through elements.
